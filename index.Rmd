# What are strings?

Strings (character types) = pretty much anything surrounded by quotes

**Double quotes** are the preferred style unless your text contains double quotes

### `"Keeps away the nargles."`

### `'Luna whispered, "Keeps away the nargles."'`

### `"Luna's eyes widened, and she whispered, \"Keeps away the nargles.\""`

# What's with the backslash?

# Escaped characters

Special characters that may have an alternate meaning

In our previous case: is `"` literally a double-quote (choop-chik) or is it marking a character string?  

--

Some other examples:

`\n` = new line  
`\t` = tab  
`\\` = backslash  

---

# Check your escapes with `writeLines()`

```{r}
writeLines("Nitwit! \n\tBlubber! \n\t\tOddment! \n\U1F9D9\t\t\tTweak!")
```

_You can also write emojis this way!_

---

# UTF-8 

Character-encoding system of choice but not fully supported by Windows (yet); this is how you can write in Hebrew, English, Chinese, and emojis in one sentence

Want to write in Hebrew? If regular Hebrew doesn't work, you can use the letter codes:

```{r}
writeLines("\U05DB\U05EA\U05D1") 
# write the letters-codes left-to-right but it prints right-to-left
```

# Key expressions 

_Note:_ There are often several ways of writing the same regex. For this presentation, I chose my favorite style, which I find the most flexible

`^` = start  
`$` = end  
`.` = anything  

```{r}
str_subset(c("football", "baseball", "ballroom"), "ball$")
```

.center[.xlarge[[.gray[one of]]]]

brackets = _one of_ the characters specified within the brackets (in the example, an `o`, `n`, `e`, space, or `f`)

`[a-z]` = any lower case letters  
`[0-9]` = any number from 0 to 9 (also `\\d`)

variations on the theme:  
`[09-]` = 0, 9, or -

# Working in a dataframe

```{r}
spells
```

```

---

```{r}
spells %>% 
  mutate(effect = str_to_lower(effect)) %>%

### Creates a _list-column_; supports vector results of different lengths

spells %>% 
  mutate(effect = str_to_lower(effect)) %>% 
  mutate(effect = str_split(effect, " ")) %>% 
  unnest(effect) #<<

### _Note:_ this is very similar to the `unnest_tokens()` function in the [`tidytext`](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) package

# Bonus question

How do you extract the currency conversions from this text?

```{r}
text <- c("There are 29 Knuts in 1 silver Sickle",
          "and there are 493 Knuts in 1 golden Galleon.")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
tibble(n_knuts = str_extract(text, "[0-9]+(?= Knuts)"),
       comparison = str_extract(text, "(?<=in )[0-9]+"),
       unit = str_extract(text, "(?<=in )[0-9 ]+[A-z ]+"))
```

Shortcut if you only care about the first number...

```{r}
parse_number(text)
```

# Summary

- strings/characters = things that are quoted in R
- backslashes are used for "escape characters" (`\n`, `\\`)
- use `writeLines()` to show how strings will display
- `stringr` provides a simple, consistent interface to work with strings in R
- regular expressions describe the logic of a pattern in text
- check regex in R with `str_view()`/`str_view_all()`
- use `unnest()` to expand list-columns
