# when does it come up?

- data stored as notes
- non-uniformly formatted data
- filenames
- almost everywhere

# let's get the basics down: what are strings?

Strings (character types) is pretty much anything surrounded by quotes

Double quotes are the preferred style unless your text contains double quotes

`"Keeps away the nargles."`  
`'Luna whispered, "Keeps away the nargles."'`  
`"Luna's eyes widened, and she whispered, \"Keeps away the nargles.\""`

# whoa, what's with the slash?

# Escaped characters = special characters that need to be marked (or may have an alternate meaning)

is `"` literally a double-quote (chook-chik) or is it marking a character string?  
`\n` = new line  
`\t` = tab  
`\\` = backslash  

---

# Check your escapes with `writeLines()`

```{r}
writeLines("Nitwit! \n\tBlubber! \n\t\tOddment! \n\U1F9D9\t\t\tTweak!")
```

---

# UTF-8 

Standard character-encoding system across *nix systems (Mac, Linux, etc) and on its way to Windows; supported by all web browsers and is the encoding system of choice

Want to write in Hebrew? If regular Hebrew doesn't work, you can use the code:

```{r}
writeLines("\U05DB\U05EA\U05D1")
```

# stringr

_A consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around the `stringi` package._

# functions for the day

- `str_count()`
- `str_detect()`
- `str_sub()`
- `str_view()`
- `str_extract()`, `str_remove()`, `str_replace()`

---

# let's get some data

```{r}
spells <- read_rds("data/spells.rds")

(incantation <- spells$incantation[1:5])


```

---

# basic pattern

`str_*(VECTOR)`

```{r}
str_to_lower(incantation)

str_count(incantation)

str_glue('Hermione shouted, "{incantation}!"')
```

---

# level 2: add a pattern

```{r}
str_detect(incantation, "o")

str_subset(incantation, "o")

str_extract(incantation, "o.")

str_replace(incantation, "o", "!")
```

---

# once more, with feeling!

```{r}
str_extract_all(incantation, "o.")

str_replace_all(incantation, "o", "!")
```

---

# level 3: use regex

`str_view()` and `str_view_all()` are your friends

# regex is hard to read and hard to write

If this presentation doesn't help, take a look at the [rebus](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rebus/rebus.pdf) package

---

# key expressions that I use
  

`.` = anything
`*` = 0 or more  
`+` = 1 or more  
  
`^` = start  
`$` = end  
  
`[a-z]` = any lower case letters  
`[0-9]` = any number from 0 to 9

variations on the theme:  
`[09-]` = 0, 9, or -

---

# mini quiz



---

# how about NOT

`[^a-z]` the caret ("hat") shows up again!  this time, with a different meaning

`\w` word

```{r}
str_split(spells$effect[1:3], " ")

str_match(spells$effect[1:3], "(\\w+) (\\w+)")
```
