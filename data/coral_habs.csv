132917,Gardineroseris planulata,"This species is found in shallow, tropical reef environments from 2-30 m. Colonies are massive to encrusting, sometimes with laminar margins. It usually occurs on walls or under overhangs in clear water  This species can be found in most reef habitats but is not a particularly common coral (Wood 1983). Sparse colonies of <em>G. planulata</em> are found from 9-15 m in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region <em>G. planulata</em> usually occurs on coral reefs and coral communities on rocky substrata at depths of 3-30 m (Guzmán, Chiriboga and Edgar pers. comm.); it also occurs on walls or under overhangs in clear water. <em>G. planulata</em> colonies are among the predominant framework builders in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (Glynn 2000). <em>G. planulata</em> has reported average growth rates of 10.4 and 13.2 mm per year in Costa Rica and Panama, respectively (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, and Glynn 1985). Reproduction of <em>G. planulata</em> is mainly sexual (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). <em>G. planulata</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996), with an alternating periodic sequential hermaphrodite mode of reproduction (spawning of first one sex then the other in given colony, in a lunar phase, and over the breeding season (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 2000). However, <em>G. planulata</em> has a high proportion of mixed sexual patterns, with gonochoric colonies usually predominating over hermaphrodites (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). This pattern of sexuality could promote outbreeding during periods of high population abundance, but still allow sexual reproduction by selfing at times of severe population decline (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1996), the earliest age of sexual reproduction for <em>G. planulata</em> is 20 years; which may retard the recovery of the population, especially in areas that have experienced catastrophic mortality. Gardinoseris planulata has revealed no sexual recruitment where seed populations are absent or rare (Galápagos Islands), and only low recruitment (Panamá) in areas with colonies that survived the ENSO disturbance (Glynn 1996). At Uva Island, Panamá, corals that recruit are subject to significant mortality by <em>Acanthaster planci</em> predation (Glynn 1996). <em>G. planulata</em> colonies are preferred prey for <em>Acanthaster planci</em>; which may affect the population structure and distribution of <em>G. planulata</em> (Fong and Glynn 1998, Glynn 2001). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1996), the slow rates of sexual recruitment of agariciid corals critically affect recovery of eastern Pacific coral communities that have experienced severe disturbances. However, according to Guzmán (pers. comm.) recruits of <em>G. planulata</em> in the Gulfs of Chiriqui and Panama are common on rocky substrates."

This species is found to 15 m. <br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. danae</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). They are the principal framework builders on Panamanian reefs (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers.

133099,Pocillopora elegans,"This species occurs in shallow reef environments. <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> occurs in all shallow water habitats on coral reefs and coral communities on rocky substrata (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. pers. comm.), to at least 20 m depth, but is most common between 1-10 m depth (Guzmán and Chiriboga pers. comm.). Maximum size is 25 cm.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> is one of the major reef building species (along with <em>P. damicornis</em>), forming intermeshing compact frameworks that can attain 2-3 m in relief (Guzmán and Cortes 1989, Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). Reported growth rates of Pocillopora elegans vary little between locations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, from 3.1 cm per year in Galápagos to 3.32 cm per year in Costa Rica (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). <br/><br/><em>P. elegans</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991), with the capacity to function as a simultaneous hermaphrodite (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991), larval settlement in the Galápagos Islands presumably has been the predominant mode of recruitment, and the only observed form of recruitment in areas that experienced high mortality (97-100%) in 1983. Asexual reproduction by fragmentation has been reported as an important mechanism for reef recovery in Panama (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). <em>P. elegans</em>, like other pocilloporid species in the eastern Pacific, has low rates of recruitment (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Histological evidence indicates that spawning is likely to occur during a few days around the new moon (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Reproductive activity in the eastern Pacific its related to local thermal regimes, with a generally higher incidence of gravid corals at sites with stable, warm water conditions, or during warming periods in areas that experience significant seasonal variation (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991) conclude that moderate El Nino warming can stimulate gametogenesis in Galápagos pocilloporid corals.<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. elegans</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001).

In Cyprus, the species occurs in the first meters of depth (1-5 m) (Hadjioannou pers. comm. 2015), whilst in several western Mediterranean locations, such as Medes Islands and Cap de Creus, the species is commonly found below 20 m depth in dim light conditions (Kersting 2013). The capacity of the species to tolerate a range of environments and to withstand seasonal abiotic factors such as temperature and light, typical of temperate seas as the <a>Mediterranean,</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;is probably related to the ability of this species to regulate autotrophy and heterotrophy depending on the environmental light conditions, as suggested by Hoogenboom <em>et al</em>. (2010).</p><p><em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> may occur in a wide range of habitats, from shallow photophilic communities to circalitoral assemblages, however, the equilibrium between hydrodynamic protection and high water exchange through strong currents seems to enhance the development of extensive <em>C. caespitosa</em> populations, as occurs in the Mjlet National Park and Columbretes Islands (Kružić and Benkovic 2008, Kesting and Linares 2012).</p><p>The high prevalence of macroalgae has been considered a limiting factor in the development of this coral (e.g., Peirano <em>et al. </em>1998, Rodolfo-Metalpa <em>et al</em>. 1999).

The maximum size is 30 cm across.<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. verrucosa</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m).

133216,Porites lobata,"This species is frequently a dominant species of back reef margins, lagoons and some fringing reefs, and can be found generally to depths of 30 m. <br/><br/>It is one of the predominant framework builders (Glynn 2000), sometimes building monospecific reef frameworks or contributing to pocilloporid reef building (Glynn 2001). <em>Porites lobata</em> is a relatively slow-growing species with reported growth rates of 8.4 mm/year in Costa Rica and 8.1 mm/year in the Galápagos; however it can grow as fast as 14 to 19 mm/year during the first few years (Guzmán and Cortes 1993, Cortés and Guzmán 1998, Guzmán and Cortés 1989). <br/><br/><em>P. lobata</em> utilizes a gonochoristic reproductive strategy (except from Caño Island, Costa Rica), and is presumably a broadcaster spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggested that eastern Pacific populations appeared to be reproductively active over multiple annual intervals, including periods of relatively low temperature. According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994), fecundity can vary between regions; <em>P. lobata</em> has higher fecundities at Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, than in the Galápagos Islands, where water temperatures are lower and more seasonally variable. Moreover, Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggest that <em>P. lobata</em> reproduces twice per year in thermally high and stable environments. Fecundity of this coral appears to benefit from moderate sea warming events, but may decline dramatically during unusually strong thermal anomalies (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). After 1983, observations of sexual recruitment have been rare to infrequent in the eastern Pacific; however sexual recruitment has been observed in some areas of the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). The almost complete absence of sexual recruitment for this species in the eastern Pacific may be due to high larval mortality in the water column; as well as increased levels of competition with benthic alga, and increased densities of grazers and bioeroders following the 1982-83 El Niño event (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/><em>Porites lobata</em> can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, Cortés and Guzmán 1998, Cortés and Jiménez 2003). In the eastern Pacific the incidental feeding activities of the triggerfish <em>Pseudobalistes naufragium</em> can generate fragments that survive to form new colonies (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, Cortés and Guzmán 1998, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). This form of fragmentation is common in Costa Rica and Panama, but uncommon in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). Fragmentation also occurs by initial weakening of colonies by bioeroders; <em>P. lobata</em> colonies possess high densities of boring bivalves (<em>Lithophaga</em> spp.), which erode the skeletal structure, a process that can also lead to fragmentation (Cortés and Jiménez 2003, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>At least eight fish species feed on live corals, with their feeding strategies ranging from removing mainly live tissue and causing little damage to the skeleton, to abrading or breaking apart colonies in the feeding process, such as during feeding of <em>Arothron meleagris</em> and <em>Pseudobalistes naufragium</em> (Guzmán and Cortes 1989, Glynn 2001). <em>Porites lobata</em> is commonly grazed by the puffer <em>Arothron meleagris</em> (Guzmán and Robertson 1989, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994)."
133217,Meandrina danae,"This species is a free-living form that inhabits sandy environments in channels between reef spurs, at the base of the fore reef, in some deeper lagoon habitats, and seagrass beds, and sloping soft-bottom communities in front of and back of the reef.

133222,Pocillopora damicornis,"This species occurs in all shallow water habitats from exposed reef fronts to mangrove swamps and wharf piles. This species is found in mono-specific stands or multi-species reefs throughout its range from near the surface to a maximum depth of 20 m. It is commonly found from 1-15 m, rarely 18-20 m, in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam. (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002) This species is considered to be a main reef-framework builder and is found from 0.5-6 m of Panama (Sheppard 1982). This species is relatively tolerant of sedimentation and low salinity as long as there is adequate water motion. Colonies reproduce by fragmentation and by sexual reproduction (broadcast spawning) (Hodgson 1998).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region the species has not been reported from mangrove environments (Cortés and Guzmán pers. comm.) but it is one of the major reef building species, forming intermeshing compact frameworks that can attain 2-3 m in relief (Glynn 2001). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). Reported growth rates of <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em> vary substantially between locations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, from 1.27 cm per year in Colombia to 3.96 cm per year in Panama (Guzmán and Cortes 1993).<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. damicornis</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15m). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). They are the principal framework builders on Panamanian reefs (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/><em>P. damicornis</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991) with the capacity to function as a simultaneous hermaphrodite (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991), larval settlement in the Galápagos Islands presumably has been the predominant mode of recruitment, and the only observed form of recruitment in areas that experienced high mortality (97-100%) in 1983. Asexual reproduction by fragmentation has been reported as an important mechanism for reef recovery in Panama (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). <em>P. damicornis</em>, like other pocilloporid species in the eastern Pacific, has low rates of recruitment (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Histological evidence indicates that spawning is likely to occur during a few days around the new moon (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Reproductive activity in the eastern Pacific its related to local thermal regimes, with a generally higher incidence of gravid corals at sites with stable, warm water conditions, or during warming periods in areas that experience significant seasonal variation (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991) conclude that moderate El Nino warming can stimulate gametogenesis in Galápagos pocilloporid corals.<br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers. These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001)."

The species is usually found intermixed with other pocilloporid corals in Costa Rica and Panama (Jiménez and Cortés 2003, Guzmán <em>et al</em>. in prep.). <br/><br/>According to Glynn (1999), <em>Pocillopora inflata</em> may have evolved within the eastern Pacific and is presently distributed widely over much of the region. Furthermore, the presence of a large dead colony of <em>P. inflata</em> in the Galápagos Urvina Bay uplift, where a coral community was elevated during a volcano eruption in 1954, indicates that <em>P. inflata</em> is not a recent ENSO-associated immigrant from the Indo-West Pacific; this species has been present in the Galápagos Islands for more than four decades (Glynn 1999).<br/><br/>Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). The growth rates of Pocillopora inflata range between 2.0 and 4.4 cm per year, with a mean growth rate of 3.15 cm per year at Bahia Culebra Costa Rica (Jiménez and Cortés 2003, Cortés and Jiménez 2003b). <br/><br/><em>Pocillopora inflata</em> is the only pocilloporid coral observed to spawn (Glynn 1999). The spawning event occurred on the morning (07:30 and 10:30 hours) of 22 March 1998 in Saboga Island, Panama (Glynn 1999). Among the six observed colonies, one spawned eggs and five produced sperm (Glynn 1999). <br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. inflata</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m). <br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers.

133407,Pocillopora eydouxi,"This species is found on exposed reef fronts and where currents are strong. <em>Pocillopora eydouxi</em> occurs in most reef environments, especially exposed reef fronts and at sits with strong currents; this coral also occurs on coral communities on rocky substrata (Hickman 2005). It has been reported from 2 m to at least 20 m depth, but commonly occurs between 5-10 m (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. pers. comm.). It may form large stands. The maximum size is over 1 m across.<br/><br/><em>P. eydouxi</em> is capable of building reef frameworks; in Santa Elena, Costa Rica, a 50 m² reef is composed exclusively of <em>P. eydouxi</em> (Cortes and Jimenez 2003). Additionally, at La Azufrada and Playa Blanca in Gorgona Island, Colombia, <em>P. eydouxi</em> forms fringing reef frameworks with large dense colonies (Zapata and Vargas-Ángel 2003). Moreover, according to Guzmán (pers. comm.), at least one reef in Colombia is formed from 100% cover of <em>P. eydouxi</em>.<br/><br/>Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). Reported growth rates of <em>Pocillopora eydouxi</em> range between 2.1 and 3.9 cm per year at Bahia Culebra, Costa Rica (Jiménez and Cortés 2003). Guzmán and Cortés (1993) reported growth rates from 3.1 cm per year in Galápagos to 3.32 cm per year in Costa Rica.<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. eydouxi</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). They are the principal framework builders on Panamanian reefs (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers. These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001)."
